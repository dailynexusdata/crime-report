            <h2>IVFP Crime Data 2013, 2018, 2019</h2>
            <div style="width: 100%">
                <p style="margin-left: 10px">Alternative policing policies focused on addressing nonviolent crime were
                    presented by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol to the Isla Vista Community Services District in the April
                    27 Board of Directors meeting, after evaluating policing trends in Isla Vista from previous years.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px">The Isla Vista Foot Patrol made crime data from 2013, 2018 and 2019
                    available which shows that the majority of crimes committed in Isla Vista are nonviolent. This data
                    also reveals that though only making up around 3% of the population, Black people made up around 6%
                    of crimes. These two statistics in particular lead to the consideration of new policing programs.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px">SNAP (Student Neighborhood Assistance Program) in San Luis Obispo was
                    presented as an example program for non-violent response focused on educating residents about noise
                    ordinance laws as a first response before having police issue tickets for later offences.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px">Current nonviolent responses in Isla Vista include the Safety Stations on
                    Friday and Saturday nights, Santa Barbara County’s CARES program for mental health emergencies and
                    the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Party Registration.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px">From the data made available, the majority of crimes can be classified as
                    related to alcohol or partying. The alcohol group includes charges such as minor in possession, open
                    container and being drunk in public. The partying group includes loud noise/music and festival
                    ordinance violations.

                <p style="margin-left: 10px">Of the top 10 crime categories, only 5.5% of the crime was violent. These
                    violent crimes include resisting arrest, fighting which includes battery and fighting in public, and
                    robberies, burglaries and theft.

                <p style="margin-left: 10px">Crimes resulted in either Arrests, Citations or no charges were filed. Of
                    all interactions with police officers resulting in a charge in 2013, 2018 and 2019, black people had
                    the highest percentage resulting in arrests. The majority of crimes resulted in citations (72%)
                    where 12% did not result in filing a charge.

                    consistent across all age groups. Ages below 25 are responsible for most of the partying and
                    disorderly conduct charges. 21 year olds commit more crimes than other age groups with 2/3rds of the
                    crime being committed by 18-23 year olds.
